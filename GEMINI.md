# Project Overview

This project implements a solution for securely connecting to one or more remote machines and executing commands, with integration into the Gemini CLI via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The core idea is to expose SSH command execution as an MCP service, allowing AI models or other clients to interact with remote systems in a standardized way.

# Tools Implemented

## `ssh_executor.py`
A Python script that utilizes the `paramiko` library to establish SSH connections to remote machines and execute commands. It handles the SSH connection, command execution, and captures the standard output and error. This script was refactored to be importable as a module.

## `mcp_server.py`
A Flask-based web server that acts as an MCP endpoint. It exposes an `/mcp/execute` endpoint that accepts POST requests containing remote host details (hostname, username, password) and the command to execute. It leverages `ssh_executor.py` to perform the actual SSH command execution and returns the results in a JSON format.

## `mcp_client.py`
A Python client script designed to interact with the `mcp_server.py`. It takes remote host details and a command as command-line arguments, sends them as a JSON payload to the MCP server, and prints the JSON response from the server. This script serves as the bridge between the Gemini CLI and the SSH execution functionality.

# Remote Machine Information (klin)

During the session, detailed information was collected about the remote machine `klin`:

## CPU Utilization Analysis (from `atopsar -C`)
The machine generally has ample idle CPU capacity. However, there were specific periods (notably between 06:50:01 and 08:20:01 on July 6, 2025) with high system CPU utilization (up to 128% for `all` CPUs) and increased I/O wait (up to 25%).

## Log Analysis (from `journalctl`)
The high CPU and I/O wait during the identified period were primarily caused by:
1.  **InfluxDB Operations:** Frequent "Cache snapshot" and "TSM compaction" tasks by the `influxd` process (`PID 6300`). These are resource-intensive operations involving significant disk I/O.
2.  **Critical Disk Failure:** Repeated warnings from `smartd` indicated a **FAILED SMART self-check** on `/dev/sda`, along with failures in several SMART usage attributes (Program_Fail_Count_Chip, Erase_Fail_Count_Chip, Wear_Leveling_Count, Program_Fail_Cnt_Total, Erase_Fail_Count_Total). This is a critical hardware issue that would severely impact disk performance and lead to high I/O wait and system CPU usage.

**Urgent Recommendation:**
**Immediate data backup of `/dev/sda` is strongly recommended due to the detected SMART errors, followed by planning for disk replacement.**
